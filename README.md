🧠 Problems Covered
🔹 Control Flow (If-Else)
ifelse.java
➤ Write a program to find the maximum between three numbers.

checkdgtalpha.java
➤ Input a character and check whether it's an alphabet, digit, or special character.

Noteprob.java
➤ Input an amount and print the minimum number of currency notes (₹500, ₹100, ₹50, ₹20, ₹10, ₹5, ₹2, ₹1) required.

sideoftrngle.java
➤ Input three sides of a triangle and classify it as Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.

elecunitchrg.java
➤ Input electricity unit charge and calculate the bill with the following rules:

First 50 units: ₹0.50/unit

Next 100 units: ₹0.75/unit

Next 100 units: ₹1.20/unit

Above 250 units: ₹1.50/unit

20% surcharge added to the total.

🔹 Loop 1 Problems
loop1.java
➤ Input a number and find the sum of its first and last digits using a loop.

q2loop.java
➤ Input a number and calculate the product of its digits.

q3loop.java
➤ Input a number and check if it is a palindrome using a loop.

q4loop.java
➤ Find the power of a number using a loop (e.g., a^b).

q5loop.java
➤ Print the Fibonacci series up to n terms using a loop.
